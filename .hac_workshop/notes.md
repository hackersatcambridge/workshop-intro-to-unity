The workshop content was improvised and built interactively with the attendees, and does not currently have a recording or detailed notes. If we record the workshop in the future we will update this repo with the video.

In the meantime, the content from the workshop is pushed (with incremental commit history), along with a GameGig 2018 entry which took the basic mechanic implemented in the workshop and gamified it.
