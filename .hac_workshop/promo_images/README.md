This directory should contain an image for promotional purposes.
Background and foreground should be separated and uploaded with filenames `bg` and `fg` respectively (plus their appropriate file extensions)

The following file extensions are supported for `bg` images:

- `.jpg`
- `.png`
- `.svg`
- `.color`: File of this type should contain nothing but a [CSS color value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#Values) (e.g. `#ffc700`, or `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.4)`)

The following file extensions are supported for `fg` images:

- `.jpg`
- `.png`
- `.svg`

Separating foreground and background images allows us to adjust features to different aspect ratios
